    description: `<p>This project was part of a wider overhaul that I completed over 2018 – 2019 for Liberate I.T. and included many pieces of collateral.</p>
    
    <p>Liberate I.T. are a top level NetSuite Solution Provider in New Zealand and Australia. I first began working with them because they wanted to overhaul their branding, which at the time was very simple and following a generic blue and grey colour scheme. Their existing logo had a star included to dot the i with, and they requested that I experiment with ways to keep the star element somehow. After showing them a range of concepts, we all agreed on this direction.</p>
    
    <p>The brief stated that not only did the brand need to elevate the corporate identity of the company, but that it needed to be unique and different enough to truly stand out against their competitors. Because of this and a number of audience-specific considerations, I went with a mix of inspirational imagery of children as superheros, alongside bright colouring with high contrast.</p>
    
    <p>These logo variations have been rolled out across a complete set of collateral.</p>`,
