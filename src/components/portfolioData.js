    <p>This included not just a design and build of the framework, but also completely reworking the content and structure. It had to be fully mobile responsive, and had to communicate to a very specific audience. This involved a balance of technical terminology, and general explanation.</p>

    <p>Because Liberate I.T. operate in both New Zealand and Australia, and they have specific offerings for each place, they wanted to have two separate sites using two location-specific domains. This meant creating a balance between content across both, and setting up a technical environment that would still be easy to manage for both interfaces.</p>

    <p>Liberate I.T. are a top level NetSuite Solution Provider in New Zealand and Australia. I first began working with them because they wanted to overhaul their branding, which at the time was very simple and following a generic blue and grey colour scheme. Their existing logo had a star included to dot the i with, and they requested that I experiment with ways to keep a star element. After showing them a range of concepts, we all agreed on this direction.</p>
    
    <p>The brief stated that not only did the brand need to elevate the corporate identity of the company, but that it needed to be unique and different enough to truly stand out against their competitors. Because of this and a number of audience-specific considerations, I went with a mix of inspirational imagery of children as superheros, alongside bright colouring with high contrast.</p>
