# Portfolio Site for Kody McIntosh

Welcome to my portfolio site repo. This site has been built using ReactJS with the intention of showcasing some of my ability as a developer. 

## Coding Information

- This project was created by using the Create React App script, and then heavily changed and customised from there. 
- The core pages are set up as components, and navigation is created using React Router V6.
- The portfolio items are created using the Outlet functionality within React Router V6, and pull from a local database file. This is to demonstrate that I understand how to use code efficiently, even when pulling from a local location.

### Running the Site Locally

If you wish to run the site locally, you can do so by using **'npm start'**. This will install all necessary dependencies, deploy the local development environments, and make them available to view on your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. Please note that if you already have something running on port 3000, you should be given the option to open this on an alternative. 

## Unit Testing

This site has a very simple passing front end test included in it. This is to demonstrate that I understand how unit tests operate within a ReactJS environment. To run the tests you can use **'npm test'**.

If you have any questions about the work in this project, please feel free to contact me.
